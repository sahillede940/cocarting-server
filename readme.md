## Backend Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ is required.
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended).

### Steps

1. Install dependencies:

   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run migrations:

   python migrate.py

   This will set up the database schema and perform any necessary migrations.

3. Start the FastAPI server:

   fastapi dev main.py

   This will start the FastAPI development server on http://127.0.0.1:8000. Use --reload for automatic updates during development.

4. Environment Variables:

   Ensure any necessary environment variables are set up

## Frontend (Chrome Extension) Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm are required.

### Steps

1. Install dependencies:

   cd frontend
   npm install

2. Build the Chrome Extension:

   npm run build

   This will create a dist/ folder containing the compiled extension files.

3. Load the Extension in Chrome:

   - Open Chrome and navigate to chrome://extensions/.
   - Enable Developer mode (toggle in the upper right corner).
   - Click on Load unpacked and select the dist/ folder in the frontend directory.

## Usage

- Backend API: The backend API documentation is available at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs once the server is running. It provides interactive documentation generated by FastAPI.
- Chrome Extension: Once loaded, the extension will be accessible via the Chrome toolbar. Click on the extension icon to interact with it.
